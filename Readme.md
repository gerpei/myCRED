# myCRED German Translation

This repository contains the translation files for the Wordpress Plugin [myCRED](https://mycred.me/) for the German language.
I use for sigular User - Nutzer*in and for plural Nutzer*innen and some diffrend translation as JHeimbach does. Sorry, I have no experience to merge both translations. So I setup a new git repository. Any help are warmly welcome.

## Installation
Copy the files `mycred-de_DE.po` and `mycred-de_DE.mo` in the language Folder of your Wordpress installation. (`wp-content/languages/plugins`).

## Contribute
The Translation is at the moment 20% completed. Help is more than appreciated.
If you want to help you can install the free Poeditor [`Poedit`](https://poedit.net/)
